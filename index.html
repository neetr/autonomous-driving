        <h1><span class="emoji">🚗</span> Autonomous Vehicle & Road Safety Analysis</h1>
        <p>This project addresses two crucial components of modern transport: developing a <b>real-time vehicle detection AI</b> for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and conducting a <b>data-driven analysis of autopilot usage and its effect on road safety</b>.</p>

        <h2>Part 1: Vehicle Detection and Localization (ITS Core)</h2>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The goal was to create a deep learning model to perform <b>Object Detection</b>—specifically, predicting the <b>type of vehicle</b> (classification) and identifying its location with a <b>bounding box</b> (localization). This capability is foundational for vehicle tracking and incident response.</p>

        <h3>Methodology: YOLO Object Detection</h3>
        <p>We employed the <b>YOLO (You Only Look Once)</b> framework. A training subset of <b>500 images</b> was used to manage resources, ensuring all required object categories were represented.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion on Part 1</h3>
        <p>The model achieved <b>strong object localization</b> but showed weaknesses in <b>vehicle classification</b>. This is primarily attributed to the <b>limited 500-image training dataset</b>. Future work will involve using a larger dataset to improve classification accuracy.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Autopilot Usage and Road Safety Analysis</h2>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To analyze real-world data concerning autopilot usage to identify accident patterns and data reporting issues.</p>

        <h3>Data Cleaning Highlights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Missing Data marked as <b>"-" (Unknown)</b> were encoded as <b>-1</b>.</li>
            <li>Extra whitespace was removed from column names and values.</li>
            <li>A reliable <b>`Date_Year`</b> column was engineered to replace the inconsistent original <b>`Year`</b> column.</li>

        <h3>Overall Conclusion on Part 2</h3>
        <p class="key-conclusion">The high prevalence of "Unknown" data for the vehicle model is the most significant finding. Effective safety analysis requires <b>standardized and complete reporting</b> mechanisms to accurately link incidents to specific vehicle models and autopilot systems.</p>
