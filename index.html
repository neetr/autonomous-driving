        <h1><span class="emoji">ðŸš—</span> Autonomous Vehicle & Road Safety Analysis</h1>
        <p>This project addresses two crucial components of modern transport: developing a **real-time vehicle detection AI** for Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and conducting a **data-driven analysis of autopilot usage and its effect on road safety**.</p>

        <h2>Part 1: Vehicle Detection and Localization (ITS Core)</h2>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The goal was to create a deep learning model to perform **Object Detection**â€”specifically, predicting the **type of vehicle** (classification) and identifying its location with a **bounding box** (localization). This capability is foundational for vehicle tracking and incident response.</p>

        <h3>Methodology: YOLO Object Detection</h3>
        <p>We employed the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** framework. A training subset of **500 images** was used to manage resources, ensuring all required object categories were represented.</p>

        <h3>Results and Performance</h3>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Metric</th>
                    <th>Result</th>
                    <th>Interpretation</th>
                </tr>

            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>$\text{mAP}@0.5$</td>
                    <td>0.413</td>
                    <td><strong>Good Localization.</strong> The model successfully places bounding boxes around vehicles.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>$\text{mAP}@0.5:0.95$</td>
                    <td>0.302</td>
                    <td><strong>Poor Classification/Precision.</strong> The model struggles to accurately classify the vehicle type while maintaining high bounding box precision.</td>
                </tr>

        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion on Part 1</h3>
        <p>The model achieved **strong object localization** but showed weaknesses in **vehicle classification**. This is primarily attributed to the **limited 500-image training dataset**. Future work will involve using a larger dataset to improve classification accuracy.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Autopilot Usage and Road Safety Analysis</h2>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To analyze real-world data concerning autopilot usage to identify accident patterns and data reporting issues.</p>

        <h3>Data Cleaning Highlights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Missing Data marked as **"-" (Unknown)** were encoded as **-1**.</li>
            <li>Extra whitespace was removed from column names and values.</li>
            <li>A reliable **`Date_Year`** column was engineered to replace the inconsistent original `Year` column.</li>

                    <td>The most frequent vehicle involved was <strong>Tesla Model -1 (Unknown)</strong>.</td>
                    <td><strong>Critical Finding:</strong> Highlights a major issue of **missing vehicle model data**, limiting specific safety analysis.</td>

        </p>

        <h3>Overall Conclusion on Part 2</h3>
        <p class="key-conclusion">The high prevalence of "Unknown" data for the vehicle model is the most significant finding. Effective safety analysis requires **standardized and complete reporting** mechanisms to accurately link incidents to specific vehicle models and autopilot systems.</p>
